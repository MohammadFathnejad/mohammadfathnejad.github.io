## About. 
<p>
Hi there! I am a Computer Science Student at Goldsmiths University of london, computer enthusiast and a normal everyday friend with a passion to teach and facilitate learning for others. 

Born in Iran and raised in different locations around the world with non-identical cultures, I have some gained some understanding towards people in general. Compared to other places, I mostly lived in London, as it is also where I am studying for a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. <br>

Though I was born in iran and Studied in Persian, I was always more pro-efficient in the English language as I am also half American and was always more comfortable speaking English rather than Farsi. However, because of the Persian Education method I am confident in Mathematics which boosted my apprehension in the C.S degree.

My passion for Teaching started when my university gave me an opportunity to facilitate learning for other students from either the same year as I was or a year below, which was called being a PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) Leader.
